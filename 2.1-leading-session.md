## 2.1 Leading a Session  ##
Remember, as Study Group Lead you are **NOT** expected to teach all or even most of the sessions. **The most successful, sustainable Study Groups leverage the experience, skills, and interest of the entire group.** A member doesn’t have to an expert in a topic to lead a session-- they just need to be motivated, have a bit of background and a willingness to explore the topic with others. Leading a session is a great way for those new to teaching to get some practice in a low-stakes environment.

The welcoming, relaxed, non-competitive tone you create for your study group will help more members feel comfortable stepping up to lead sessions. **If you think a member might have a certain skill or technology to share, invite them to lead a session on it!** (You should know about the research interests and skills of each member because, as in tip #3 above, you’ve asked them to introduce themselves and their work to the group.) 

If you or members of your study group produce notes, challenge exercises, or coding examples as you plan and hold your Study Group meetings (and you should!), we hope you’ll share them! **To help you organize the content you generate, and to make sure it’s truly usable and useful for others, we’ve created a [Lesson Template](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lesson-template.md) (it's part of the Study Group Repository) for you to use for any notes, guides, challenges, or examples you share (we’re calling these materials, loosely  “lessons”).**  

Once you’ve created your lesson notes using the template, and tested out your lesson with your Study Group, we hope you’ll add it to the Study Group Lesson repository.  This repo enables skills-sharing among Study Groups worldwide. Anyone can access these open resources; it’s a way of maximizing the learning potential and power of all our Groups, worldwide. **[Explore the Lesson Repository here](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons)**. 

In additon to the template, we've provided tips for new session leaders in the next section. Share these with any prospective leads. Remind members that it’s most useful and authentic to see how they use a tool or skill in their research practice; they don’t need to present an in-depth, advanced 90 minute lecture on a topic. Each session will be a bit different, but here are three excellent guiding principles for leading a session, developed by the University of Toronto Study Group:


* **Keep the code you’re working with as simple as possible while still covering the concept.**
* **When making the code, make no or few assumptions about the knowledge of the audience.**
* **Keep the code generalizable. Members may come from diverse fields of research. What we share is the need to code.**
