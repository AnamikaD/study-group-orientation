#### 1.1 About Mozilla Study Groups

A Mozilla Study Group is a regular, in-person, informal meet-up where people get together to learn to code and to explore open research practice-- strategies for maximizing the quality and impact of research in any field, from astrophysics to sociology. Coding skills in particular are increasingly important in data-rich research environments, but many of us don’t have formal training in computer science…. and the tools and technologies we need are always changing. Mozilla Study Groups are peer-to-peer learning environments for skill-sharing, idea discovery, community support, and collaboration. 

#### Why join a Study group?

* Learn and share new coding skills you need, learn and problem-solve faster with others
* Super-power your research through collaboration and open science best practices
* Be part of the discussion around transforming research practice 
* Connect to a network of research leaders across disciplines
* Make friends and  become part of a supportive learning community

#### Why start a Study Group?
* Learn teaching and facilitation skills, community building skills
* Get support and mentoring from Mozilla Science Lab and the Mozilla network
* Show leadership in your community, gain skills to advance your career
* Access resources like our beautiful website template and library of coding lessons
* Add some open source sparkle to your work by association with the Mozilla brand  

There are Mozilla Study Groups all around the world, many at academic institutions and research organizations. Anyone can start a group. The format and schedule for study groups is flexible: you can modify it to fit the needs of your members. It’s all up to you! 

Mozilla Science Lab helps out by providing this training, an easy-to-use template for a website, templates for advertising materials, and by managing an awesome collection of lessons created by Study Group members from around the world. We organize regular calls where study group members can connect and share what they’ve been doing with others. MSL also supports other community events and gatherings (you’ll learn more about these in Module x). Here’s what a few different study groups look like in real life:

#### 1.4 The Study Group Lead Role

The work you’ll do as a Study Group lead will ramp up slowly, because most groups start small. Your tasks will change over time as your group grows and changes. As Study Group Lead, you’ll do a mix of the following tasks:

* Outreach and communications, as you find your first few members and getabout the group, and as you publicize each of the group’s meetings and events;
* Logistics and event coordination, as you organize group meetings and events;
* Strategy and planning, as you create a schedule and plan for your group over a semester or year, and tweak that plan to respond to the needs of your group;
* Teaching, as you prepare some of the materials and facilitate skill-sharing sessions for your group;
* Community-building, as you find ways to invite new members in and expand your group;
* Mentoring, as you create a group that leverages the skills and abilities of all members in co-teaching, co-facilitating, and co-organizing-- in other words, you get lots of help!

This last point about sharing responsibility and mentoring others to help lead is very important for the long-term survival of your Study Group! Bringing on others to co-lead will help you create a successful, sustainable group, one that will live on if you decide to move on to a new job or a different institution. 

You’re not required to be an expert coder to lead a Study Group! Some coding experience is helpful, but you mostly need to be curious, motivated, and willing to jump in, get your hands dirty, and learn and share with other group members. 

To lead a successful Group, you’ll also need to be consistent (showing up on time, holding regular meetings). And you’ll need to be patient and persist while your Group gets off the ground, be willing to dedicate some of your time to the project-- usually about a few hours a week. In return you’ll get valuable experience in communications, event planning, teaching, and working collaboratively with other researchers, not to mention improving your own research practice! And you’ll expand your professional network and connections into a broader research community. 

#### 1.3 Who Can Join Your Study Group?

Your Study Group should welcome anyone who’s interested and shares your goals of learning to code together, and improving research through open practice. You’ll likely start out with a few members you know well, people from your lab or department. It’s fine to start small, and in familiar territory-- most groups do. But-- if you extend invitations to other departments, labs, and disciplines-- you’ll likely find that researchers of all stripes want to learn the same or similar tools, and share the same kinds of research problems around data analysis and visualization, data management, collaborative workflows, and much more. Don’t feel limited by your field or area of expertise-- this is a great opportunity to make interdisciplinary connections! 

Mozilla Study Groups are inclusive, friendly, safe, and welcoming environments for all participants, regardless of their gender, ethnic background, sexual orientation, age, skill level, preference for text editor or coding langauge, etc.  Beginners in particular should feel welcome at your Study Group sessions-- this is a low-pressure, relaxed environment for learning together! In Exercise 1.4, you’ll take some time to think about how to create that positive learning environment by writing a Code of Conduct, a statement or set of guidelines that describes your Group culture, and defines social norms and responsibilities for members of your Group.
