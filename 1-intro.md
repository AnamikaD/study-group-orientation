#Hello there!

Welcome to the Mozilla Science Lab's Study Group Orientation Series! We're glad you're here.

This series is designed for completion online, as a solo training experience, done at your own pace.  

In this first section, you'll get a sense of what Study Groups are all about, and why you should lead one. In Section 2 you'll get tips on how to facilitate great Group meetings and learn about formats for sessions. In Section 3, we'll walk you through how to work with the collaboration platform GitHub, which will power your Group's website and enable you to share and work together on materials and code. In Section 4, you'll get a whirlwind introduction to some of the key issues and resources related to "open" research. And finally, in Section 5, you'll get tips on how to grow your group, from communication strategies to planning sessions and meetings over the long term.
