##Hello there!

Welcome to the Mozilla Science Lab's Study Group Orientation Series! We're glad you're here.

A [Mozilla Study Group](https://github.com/mozillascience/studygroup) is a regular, in-person, informal meet-up where people get together to learn to code and learn about open research practice. It's a peer-to-peer learning environment designed for skill-sharing, idea discovery, community support, and collaboration. Anyone can start a Mozilla Study Group. This online training will help you jumpstart your own Study Group.
