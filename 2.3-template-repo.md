##2.4 The Lesson Template and Lesson Repository##
If you or members of your study group produce notes, challenge exercises, or coding examples as you plan and hold your Study Group meetings (and you should!), we hope you’ll share them!   

To help you organize the content you generate, and to make sure it’s truly usable and useful for others, we’ve created a template for you to use for any notes, guides, challenges, or examples you share (we’re calling these materials  “lessons”). 

The template is here. ###link to template issue in SG repo##

Once you’ve created your lesson notes using the template, and tested out your lesson with your Study Group, we hope you’ll add it to the Study Group Lesson repository.  This repo enables skills-sharing among Study Groups worldwide. Anyone can access these open resources; it’s a way of maximizing the learning potential and power of all our Groups, worldwide.
