#### 1.3 Who Can Join Your Study Group?

Your Study Group should welcome anyone who’s interested and shares your goals of learning to code together, and improving research through open practice. You’ll likely start out with a few members you know well, people from your lab or department. It’s fine to start small, and in familiar territory-- most groups do. But-- if you extend invitations to other departments, labs, and disciplines-- you’ll likely find that researchers of all stripes want to learn the same or similar tools, and share the same kinds of research problems around data analysis and visualization, data management, collaborative workflows, and much more. Don’t feel limited by your field or area of expertise-- this is a great opportunity to make interdisciplinary connections! 

Mozilla Study Groups are inclusive, friendly, safe, and welcoming environments for all participants, regardless of their gender, ethnic background, sexual orientation, age, skill level, preference for text editor or coding langauge, etc.  Beginners in particular should feel welcome at your Study Group sessions-- this is a low-pressure, relaxed environment for learning together! In Exercise 1.4, you’ll take some time to think about how to create that positive learning environment by writing a Code of Conduct, a statement or set of guidelines that describes your Group culture, and defines social norms and responsibilities for members of your Group.
