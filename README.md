## About Study Groups

A [Mozilla Study Group](https://github.com/mozillascience/studygroup) is a regular, in-person, informal meet-up where people get together to learn to code and learn about open research practice. It's a peer-to-peer learning environment designed for skill-sharing, idea discovery, community support, and collaboration. Anyone can start a Mozilla Study Group. This online training will help you jumpstart your own Study Group. 

Before you get started, check our map to see if thereâ€™s already a Study Group in your area.
