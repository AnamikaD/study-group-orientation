#### 1.4 Where to Connect and Get Help 
We encourage Study Group Leads from different groups to connect and share resources! We aim to gather a group of aspiring Study Group Leads to work through this training twice a year, roughly aligned with the Fall-Spring Academic Calendar. 

If you're joining us at one of those times, please join us for **Office Hours**(check the schedule here). A Mozilla Staff memeber and a seasoned Study Group Lead will be available by video chat or phone to answer your questions. 

You can also join our **Chat room on Gitter**, a web-based chat client that's associated with the Study Group Rep. Sign-in to join! The Gitter chatroom is open 24 hours a day, and it's a great place to ask questions, share news and ideas, and just hang out with other Study Group Leads. 

We hold regular **Study Group Calls** to share and discuss new resources, materials and ideas for Study Groups, to plan Sprints and other inter-group collaborations, and to network and connect! These are video conference calls, but you can also dial in toll-free by phone. Check our Events page for the details about the next call.

Finally, if you have a question or problem, you can reach out to **Zannah Marsh, Mozilla's Learning Strategist, or Aurelia Moser, Mozilla's Community Lead**. The best way to do this is **file a GitHub issue** in this Orientation Repo, or in the Study Group repo, or ping us on the Gitter Chat. (If you're not familiar with GitHub, dont' worry! You'll learn a lot more about GitHub in Section 3 of this training!)
