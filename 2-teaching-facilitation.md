##2.1 Facilitation Basics for Study Groups##
The most successful study groups are welcoming, friendly, personable environments. **Complete newcomers to coding should feel comfortable, and a bit (or sometimes a lot) of confusion is expected as you work through new concepts and tools-- it’s part of the learning process.**

This isn’t a space to show off your own skills or an opportunity to outshine others, it’s a mini-community where you’re all getting to know each other, and working together to help each other learn. It helps for Study Group Leads to create this space with intention, as it may not be typical of some research and work environments. Even if another member is presenting material, the Study Group Lead should be in a back-seat facilitator role, gently and thoughfully helping to ensure the meeting goes well.  

Here are some tips for facilitating Group meetings:  

* **Arrive Early.** Get to the meeting space 10 minutes before the start time so you can set up, and be sure to give arriving members some time to greet each other and get settled before you jump into the session.  
* **Greet newcomers** Say hello! Introduce yourself to any newcomers and welcome them to the Group, or have someone assigned to do so at each session.
* **Make Introductions.** Ask participants to introduce themselves to the Group. Ask them to briefly describe their research practice, tools they use, and any skills they have, or want to gain. This is a great way to discover common interests among members. 
* **Be relaxed and friendly.** Make sure your tone of voice and body language are open and positive.
* **Encourage questions!** Making time for dialog and questions speeds learning for all members as you come to answers together. There are no stupid questions!
* **Slow down.** Slow the pace of lessons and presentations down if people seem to be struggling-- there’s no rush. 
* **Share successes AND failures.** If something isn’t working, encourage members to share! It’s an opportunity to practice debugging skills together. The more eyes on the problem, the better!
* **Orient newcomers to Group Systems**  Make sure newcomers know where  the website is, and tell them about the GitHub repo, email lists, social media feeds and groups, and any other systems you use.


## 2.2 Leading Sessions ##
Remember, as Study Group Lead you are **NOT** expected to teach all or even most of the sessions. **The most successful, sustainable Study Groups leverage the experience, skills, and interest of the entire group.** A member doesn’t have to an expert in a topic to lead a session-- they just need to be motivated, have a bit of background and a willingness to explore the topic with others. Leading a session is a great way for those new to teaching to get some practice in a low-stakes environment.

The welcoming, relaxed, non-competitive tone you create for your study group will help more members feel comfortable stepping up to lead sessions. **If you think a member might have a certain skill or technology to share, invite them to lead a session on it!** (You should know about the research interests and skills of each member because, as in tip #3 above, you’ve asked them to introduce themselves and their work to the group.) 

We’ve provided tips and templates for new session leaders as part of these materials (see below), so share them with any prospective leads. Remind members that it’s most useful and authentic to see how they use a tool or skill in their research practice; they don’t need to present an in-depth, advanced 90 minute lecture on a topic.

Each session and format will be a bit different, but here are three excellent guiding principles for leading a session, developed by the University of Toronto Study Group:


* **Keep the code you’re working with as simple as possible while still covering the concept.**
* **When making the code, make no or few assumptions about the knowledge of the audience.**
* **Keep the code generalizable. Members may come from diverse fields of research. What we share is the need to code.**

##2.3 Options for Study Group Sessions##

As mentioned in module 1, “Introducing Mozilla Study Groups,” the format and schedule for study groups is flexible. You can modify it to fit the needs of your members, and revise or change it depending on what you find works best for your group. Here some formats that have worked well in Mozilla Study Groups to date. Got a great idea for another format? Tell us about it here!

**Format:** Work-Along
**Description:** A hands-on guided tour of a piece of code, tool, or other skill.  
**Time Required:** 1+ hours to prepare; event time: 1 hour.  
**How To Do It:** In this skill-sharing model, one group member demonstrates how they use a particular piece of code, tool, or other skill in their research, while everyone else follows along. It’s best if all members have laptops to work on, and the person who’s demonstrating can project their own screen for easy viewing. Work-alongs help your community discover new tools and see novel solutions to common problems. The presenter should have a plan, a set of notes, and some ideas for basic challenges or problems. it’s great if this documentation can follow the Study Group Template (see below), but remember this is not a lecture, it’s really all about learners trying out the skill themselves. See our list of tips for Work-Along presenters.  

**Format:** Co-Working session  
**Description:** An open session where members work on separate projects, but help each other with problems and questions, and share successes.  
**Time Required:** no time to prepare; event time: 2 hours  
**How To Do It:**  Get your Study Group together for a couple of hours.  Start the session by having each member share (very briefly) what they are working on. After intros, everyone gets to work on their own project, but each member is encouraged to ask questions if they’re stuck, and share successes while they work. Co-working sessions are easy to run, and the format encourages collaboration, skill-sharing, and hands-on problem-solving in a casual, low-pressure environment… all while members to make progress on their own work! See our list of tips for co-working facilitators here. 


**Format:** Strategy Circle  
**Description :** A go-around where members describe a particular problem or issue they are facing, and the group together talks through solutions to each problem.   
**Time Required:** minimal time to prepare; event time: 1 to 1.5 hours   
**How to Do it:** Let members know in advance that they can come with a challenge or problem. One by one, invite members to describe their problem, and then open the floor for suggestions and a discussion of what kind of packages, tools or strategies they could try out to solve their problem. After each problem is discussed, spend the remaining time experimenting with those new ideas and getting help in a co-working session with the entire group.

**Format:** Hacky Hour  
**Description:** A pub night or cafe meeting for researchers who are curious about code and open practice.   
**Time Required:** minimal time to prepare (sending out invites);  event time: flexible  
**How To Do It:** A Hacky Hour is an informal, social get-together where community members meet one another, discuss new ideas, and build the personal ties that help strengthen any community. Hacky Hours are the easiest events to organize, since all that's required is an open cafe or pub! Hacky Hours are great “first-time” events for those curious about Study Groups. Holding a few Hacky Hours is an excellent way to recruit new Group members. As host, you’ll be focused on welcoming attendees and making introductions and connections. See our list of tips for hosting a successful Hacky Hour. 

**Format:** Lightning Demo Series  
**Description:** A series of short (10-15 minute) introductions to a tool, programming library, or piece of code.  
**Time Required:** time to prepare: minimal (identify/invite presenters from your group); event time: about an hour  
**How To Do It:** Ask four or five members to prepare short (10-15 minute) demonstrations of their favorite tool, library, or piece of code. These demos are meant only as short introductions to allow the audience to decide if they’re interested in learning more. Unlike work-a-longs, the audience isn’t expected to try out the tool or code during the demo, they’re just engaged, interested spectators. The presenter should encourage questions, and be sure to provide context for the tool, explaining how they use it in their own research. Switching between potentially wildly different ideas in a lecture format can get exhausting for the audience after more than an hour, so limit your number of presenters. If you have lots of willing presenters, consider throwing a Lightning Demo Party.

**Format:** Lighting Demo Party  
**Description:** A mixer event with a science-fair set-up where the audience can walk around to get (5 minute) introductions to a tool, programming library, or piece of code.  
**Time Required:** time to prepare: minimal (identify/invite presenters from your group, invite a lot of guests) event time: 1.5 hours.   
**How To Do It:** Like the Hacky Hour, the Lighting Demo Party is an informal, social get-together where community members meet one another, discuss new ideas, and make friends. The main event is a series of 8 to 10 demos, set up around the room, with presenters at each station, ready to share and explain their tool or skill and chat with anyone who stops by. As above, presenters should be sure to introduce their research projects and the context in which they use the tool or code. These demos are shorter than those in the Demo Series, so people have time to experience each one during the event. Setting demos up in a big horse-shoe pattern lets people easily circulate, socialize, and talk about how they’ll use all these great new tools and ideas. Serve snacks and drinks if you like, and be sure to invite lots of people, so you have a good audience for your presenters. 

These are just a few possible formats for your Study Group Meetings. If there’s another format you’ve used successfully or plan to test out, tell us about it here! 

##2.4 The Lesson Template and Lesson Repository##
If you or members of your study group produce notes, challenge exercises, or coding examples as you plan and hold your Study Group meetings (and you should!), we hope you’ll share them!   

To help you organize the content you generate, and to make sure it’s truly usable and useful for others, we’ve created a template for you to use for any notes, guides, challenges, or examples you share (we’re calling these materials  “lessons”). The template is here.
 
###link to template issue in SG repo##

Once you’ve created your lesson notes using the template, and tested out your lesson with your Study Group, we hope you’ll add it to the Study Group Lesson repository.  This repo enables skills-sharing among Study Groups worldwide. Anyone can access these open resources; it’s a way of maximizing the learning potential and power of all our Groups, worldwide. Explore the Lesson Repository here. 

##2.5 Planning your first meeting##
Now that you’ve got a sense of what a Study Group session might look like, you’re ready to plan your first meeting! Here are some tips for getting started:

* **Do a bit of audience research.** Poll some potential attendees to see if there’s a topic that most people want to learn (like R or Python). If so, you can start with that. Or, check out our list of suggested first sessions. 
* **Find a meeting space.** You can use a free classroom space or conference room, or you can meet in a common area like a student center, library, or even a local bar or cafe. Keep in mind the noise level and access to power and wi-fi. 
* **Pick a time.** Schedule meetings when people are most likely to be around and free-- perhaps there’s an obvious space in the schedule (after a lab meeting or a certain required course) when most people are on campus. 
* **Decide how long you’ll meet.**Depending on schedules, and what you want to get done, your study group could meet for an hour, an hour and a half, or more. 
* **Meet regularly.**It may help to hold meetings on the same day of the week and at the same time each time you meet, so members can plan in advance and are more likely to remember meetings.
* **Send reminders.**Send out a quick email and/or tweet the day before each meeting, so people know it’s on!
* **Be ready to welcome everyone!** A successful Study Group requires a set of members who know eachother and feel comfortable together-- start creating a postitve, friendly environment from the first meeting.
